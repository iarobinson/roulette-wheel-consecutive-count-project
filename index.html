  <h1>Consecutive Finder</h1>
  <p>This tool can generate as many roulette wheels spins as you desire.</p>
  <p>It is designed to tell you how many consecutive results occure in that batch of roulette spins.</p>
  <p>For example, if you played 5 roulette spins and the results were black, red, red, red and black, you would have had a maximum consecutive red results of 3.</p>
  <p>Enjoy!</p>
  <form id="form" onsubmit="return false;">
    <p>Input your desired spin count here (100 to 10 million is fine):</p>
    <input type="text" id="userInput" />
    <input type="submit" onclick="othername();" />
    <p><em>Be careful because huge numbers can be a problem for your browser. It could crash if you go nuts.</em></p>
